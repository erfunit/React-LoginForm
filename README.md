To add an image into a ReactJS project, you can follow these steps:

1. Place your image file in the project directory: Move your image file (e.g., `image.jpg`, `logo.png`) to a folder within your React project, typically in the `src` directory.

2. Import the image: In the component where you want to use the image, import it using the appropriate path. For example, if your image is in a folder called `images` within the `src` directory, you can import it like this:

```jsx
import MyImage from './images/image.jpg';
```

3. Use the image: You can then use the imported image in your component's JSX code. Here's an example of how to display the image using an `<img>` tag:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import MyImage from './images/image.jpg';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={MyImage} alt="My Image" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Make sure to replace `MyComponent` with the name of your actual component, and `MyImage` with the name you used in the import statement.

4. Run the project: Save your changes and run your React project. The image should now be displayed in the component where you added the `<img>` tag.

Note: Ensure that the path provided in the `src` attribute of the `<img>` tag is correct, relative to the location of the component file where you are using the image.
